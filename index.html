			<h2>Taskr</h2>
			<p>I was a Software Engineering Intern on 
				<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune">Intune's</a> 
				mobile app management (MAM) team for Android. They develop an SDK that allows IT
				pros to make tightly managed apps. I made an example app demonstrating how to use 
				this SDK called Taskr. Taskr is open source and available on 
				<a href="https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/Taskr-Sample-Intune-Android-App">GitHub</a>.
			</p>

			<p>I finished this project in half of my internship, so I spent the rest of the 
				time fixing bugs on sprints with my team. I specifically focused on bugs that 
				had arisen from multi-process Android apps.

			<p>At Brown Space Engineering, we are dedicated to making space more accessible for 
				people of all backgrounds. Following our schematics, anyone can make a satellite 
				for only $3,776. Successfully deployed on July 13th, 2018, EQUiSat is the first 
				satellite to test <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery">LiFePO</a> 
				batteries in space and its four LEDs are visible by the naked eye. I have worked
				on organizing satellite operations using <a href="http://www.freertos.org/">FreeRTOS</a> 
				and optimizing data transmission, especially error packaging.
			</p>

			<p> I am now project manager and co-president, so in addition to coordinating satellite 
				operations and managing our over 75 members, I am also leading the design of our 
				next CubeSat. I am responsible for effective communication with NASA, the University, 
				and any other external entity.

			<h2>Wikispeedia</h2>

			<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiracing">Wikipedia game</a> is an old 
				standby for bored teens, but it's rarely done right. For our final project for 
				CS 32 at Brown, Mckenna Cisler, Rohan Jha, Sean Hastings and I decided to perfect 
				this age-old game. I worked on the user experience, including lobby experience, 
				site-wide design, and graphic design. I also set up hosting so anyone can play online.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Want to play the game yourself?</strong> You can play 
				<a href="http://wikispeedia.herokuapp.com">here</a>! Since it is hosted on Heroku's 
				free tier, please give the app a few seconds to start up.
				You can view the code on our <a href="https://github.com/MckennaCisler/wikispeedia">project GitHub repo</a>.

			<h2>National Weather Service</h2>
			<p>Despite having the best weather information available online, the National Weather 
				Service's website looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1990s. I check it 
				most days, and almost every time I do I'm frustrated by the terrible interface. 
				So when we chose websites to redesign for CSCI 1300: UI/UX, I knew I wanted to
				choose it. By simplifying the interface, a move that also makes it look more modern, 
				I believe I made the information significantly more accessible. This is the 
				interface that the National Weather Service should have for the 21st century.
			</p>

			<img src="assets/nws-mockup.png" alt="A preliminary wire frame of the interface">
			<p class="img-caption">A preliminary wire frame of the interface</p>

			<p>I started by making wire frames of the interface, got feedback on them, then 
				made a high-fidelity mockup in Adobe XD. The feedback I got on that interface 
				was positive, so I made a web-ready version of the forecast page, pictured below.
				It is designed to respond properly to any screen size.

			<h2>The Social Playlist</h2>
			<p>Ever wanted to play music at a party but allow your friends to pick some of the 
				music? The Social Playlist attempts to solve that problem by allowing a host 
				to set up a room which visitors can join. Visitors can suggest songs (which are 
				automatically queued on YouTube) which the host can rearrange or reject. We also
				attempted to use Microsoft's Emotion API to suggest a playlist based on the mood 
				detected by a device's webcam. This project was created at
				<a href="https://hackatbrown.org">Hack@Brown 2017</a>. 
				I made all user-facing components and attempted to integrate Microsoft's Emotion API.

			<h2>Rocket Filtering</h2>
			<p>This website, written for CSCI 1300: UI/UX, demonstrates a number of the principles 
				learned in that class. First, it's clear that the only controllable sections of 
				the interface are at the top of the page. Filters are on the top left, then 
				sorting, then search is on the top right. These are fairly standardized positions 
				for the respective components. The grid layout make it easier for users to see more 
				information than a linear layout would have been. These features work to promote 
				the central goal of the site - comparing rockets by a variety of criteria. With 
				more information this site could be useful for space mission managers to compare and
				pick rockets for launches.
			</p>

			<p>The project is live <a href="https://rocket-filtering.herokuapp.com/">here</a> 
				and the code is available 
				<a href="https://github.com/jleiken/filtering-rockets">on GitHub</a>.
