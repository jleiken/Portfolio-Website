				Brown Space Engineering is are dedicated to making space more accessible for
				people of all backgrounds. Following our schematics, anyone can make a satellite
				for only $3,776. Successfully deployed on July 13th, 2018, EQUiSat is the first
				satellite to test <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery">LiFePO</a>
				batteries in space and its four LEDs are visible by the naked eye. I worked
				on organizing satellite operations using <a href="http://www.freertos.org/">FreeRTOS</a>
				and optimizing data transmission, especially error packaging.
				<br><br>
				I became project manager and co-president in 2018, so in addition to coordinating satellite
				operations and managing our over 75 members, I led the design of our
				next CubeSat, PVDX. I was responsible for communication with NASA, the University,
				and any other external entity.

				The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiracing">Wikipedia game</a> is an old
				standby for bored teens, but it's rarely done right. For my final project for
				CS 32 at Brown, my group and I decided to perfect this age-old game.
				I worked on the user experience, including lobby experience,
				site-wide design, and graphic design. I also set up hosting so anyone can play online.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Want to play the game yourself?</strong> You can play
				<a href="http://wikispeedia.herokuapp.com">here</a>! Since it is hosted on Heroku's
				free tier, please give the app a few seconds to start up.

				Since mid 2016, I've been continuously redesigning
				<a href="https://jleiken.com">jleiken.com</a>, this site. In this most recent iteration,
				I decided to mimic the experience of using a terminal. Nearly every semester
				in college I found myself writing a REPL, so I have very strong ideas about what
				I like and what I don't. Drawing on that experience, combined
				with my modern Javascript experience at Amazon, I decided to write this website in
				pure ES, no jQuery involved. The static version, for mobile and visitors unfamiliar
				with terminals, serves as a template for the REPL version. This means that the
				Javascript can pull from the HTML - there are very few strings that contain HTML code.
				<br><br>
				The site is hosted on Github Pages and uses Jekyll for Sass. If you're interested
				in how I wrote this site, you can view the source code on
				<a href="https://github.com/jleiken/Portfolio-Website" target="_blank">Github</a>.
				The REPL is defined in <code>js/repl.js</code> and run from <code>js/index.js</code>.
