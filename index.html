                        would not be my whole career. I've always wanted to work in public interest over corporate, 
                        but I still wanted to use my knowledge about technology. I believe law is the best field 
                        for that intersection. So, I now am a student at NYU Law and recipient of the Desmarais Law and Technology Scholarship.
                        At school, I'm a web designer and student fellow for the <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili/privacy_research_group">Privacy Research Group</a>, president of

                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiracing">Wikipedia game</a> is an old
                        standby for bored teens, but it's rarely done right. For my final project for
                        CS 32 at Brown, my group and I decided to perfect this age-old game.
                        I worked on the user experience, including lobby experience,
                        site-wide design, and graphic design. I also set up hosting so anyone can play online.

                        Since mid 2016, I've been continuously redesigning
                        <a href="https://jleiken.com">jleiken.com</a>, this site. In this most recent iteration,
                        I decided to mimic the experience of using a terminal. Nearly every semester
                        in college I found myself writing a REPL, so I have very strong ideas about what
                        I like and what I don't. Drawing on that experience, combined
                        with my modern Javascript experience at Amazon, I decided to write this website in
                        pure ES, no jQuery involved. The static version, for mobile and visitors unfamiliar
                        with terminals, serves as a template for the REPL version. This means that the
                        Javascript can pull from the HTML - there are very few strings that contain HTML code.
                        <br><br>
                        The site is hosted on Github Pages and uses Jekyll for Sass. If you're interested
                        in how I wrote this site, you can view the source code on
                        <a href="https://github.com/jleiken/Portfolio-Website" target="_blank">Github</a>.
                        The REPL is defined in <code>js/repl.js</code> and run from <code>js/index.js</code>.
