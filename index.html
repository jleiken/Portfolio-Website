                        would not be my whole career. I've always wanted to work in public interest over corporate, 
                        but I still wanted to use my knowledge about technology. I believe law is the best field 
                        for that intersection. So, I now am a student at NYU Law and recipient of the Desmarais Law and Technology Scholarship.
                        At school, I'm Senior Online Editor on the <a href="https://nyujlpp.org/">Journal of Law and Public Policy</a>, web designer and a student fellow for the <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili/privacy_research_group">Privacy Research Group</a>, and a research assistant for Professor Sunoo Park.

                        in-app purchases and ads was donated to non-profits.
